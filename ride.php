					<h3>Day 1  //  Sep 12: Myrtle Creek to Camas Valley</h3>
					<p>Your weeklong adventure begins with the wild and scenic Umpqua River keeping you company. You’ll parallel the river through miles of flat valley roads while taking in views of hillside farms and ranches. Lunch happens in Lookingglass before you follow the historic Coos Bay Wagon Road through small towns, wineries, and farms. Some small climbs with smooth descents will lead you to the outskirts of the coastal range. You can choose to take an optional killer climb followed by a two-mile descent into Camas Valley, where all riders will nestle in for the night.</p>

				<h2>Rider Guests</h2>
				<p>Cycle Oregon welcomes Rider Guests and Support Vehicles, and we do our very best to accommodate their needs. However, we deal with the very limited space in some of our host sites, which limits our capacity for Rider Guests or Support Vehicles (surprisingly, the footprint for the Rider Guest/Support Vehicle parking area can be as large as that or our Tent City).</p>
				<h5>Vehicle Registration Fee</h5>
				<p>A registration fee of $500 is required for each Rider Guest/Support Vehicle. The fee includes access to the services provided at the overnight site including showers, restrooms, beer garden, daily entertainment, other food vendors, and medical tent. It does not include food. Food can be purchased for an additional fee during the registration process.</p>
				<h5>Please note an important change to our 2016 policy:</h5>
				<p>All tent campers in the Rider Guest/Support Vehicle area must display a valid Cycle Oregon Tent Tag. Each Rider Guest/Support Vehicle will be provided with three tags. Additional tags may be purchaced for $10 during registration and via the link in your confirmation email. Only tents displaying tent tags will be allowed to set up in the Rider Guest/Support Vehicle area.</p>
